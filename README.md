The primary goal of this project was to analyze and predict bike rental demand using a dataset, leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques.

# Project Overview
The increasing use of bike-sharing systems has made it important to understand rental patterns and predict demand accurately. This project involves building a predictive model using Python, exploring data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques.

# Objectives:
To explore the given dataset and derive meaningful insights.
To preprocess the data for better model performance.
To build a machine learning model capable of predicting bike rentals.
Contents of the Repository
## 1. Notebook File
The core of the repository is the Jupyter Notebook: BikeRental_HarisSaifi (1).ipynb. It contains:

Data loading and cleaning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations and descriptive statistics.
Feature engineering and selection.
Machine learning model development and evaluation.
## 2. Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook includes variables such as:

Date and time information.
Weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
Holiday and working day indicators.
Rental counts as the target variable.
(Note: Ensure the dataset file is in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the path in the code.)

## 3. Outputs
The notebook generates the following outputs:

# Insights from the EDA.
Performance metrics of the machine learning model.
Predicted rental counts for new data.
How to Use
Prerequisites:
Python 3.7 or higher.
